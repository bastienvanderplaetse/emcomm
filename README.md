# Emergent Communication for Multi-Agent Systems based on Lewis Game

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation for the paper [Influence of image encoders and image features transformations in emergent communication](https://www.esann.org/program) and is based on [Google Deepmind's emergent communication at scale](https://github.com/google-deepmind/emergent_communication_at_scale).

To train the model, open the file _train.py_ to change the hyperparameters (lines 20 to 25). Hyperparameters at lines 28-60 contain the values that were used in the paper. To run the training, use the command _python train.py_.

### Notes

Further explanations are coming soon on this page!

Evaluation scripts will soon be available !
